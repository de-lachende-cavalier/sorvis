A collection of notes about NCAs useful for the final report/presentation/personal use.

"What is clear is that evolution has learned to exploit the laws of physics and computation to implement the highly robust morphogenetic software that runs on genome-encoded cellular hardware."[1]

- Need to find out the algorithms at the base of morphogenesis
- Multiple subroutines (e.g. "build an eye here") => how many? how complex? how do they interact? what about building "micro" networks and coordinating them? => I smell RL...

"Imagine if we could design systems of the same plasticity and robustness as biological life: structures and machines that could grow and repair themselves."[1]

- The genome bottleneck; intelligence as compression => resolve the genome bottleneck = resolve intelligence? (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutter_Prize>)

- Deep Learning as "the art of stacking together differentiable functions, and optimizing their parameters to perform various tasks"[1]

"Hidden channels don’t have a predefined meaning, and it’s up to the update rule to decide what to use them for."[1]

- How can we speed up training? Besides simplifying input data (i.e. black and white instead of RGB, with lower resolution), we notice that the loss history is flat for almost 200 epochs!
