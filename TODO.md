- [x] finish reviewing the material on distill
- [x] separate the useful code from the visualization et alia and put it into a separate notebook
  - [x] create a git repo to track everything (it will be the project repo)
- [ ] check that training progresses as it should (something weird seems to be happening?)
  - [ ] check the tensor shapes and track everything (!)
- [ ] run some experiments
- [ ] play around with visualizing what the network learns => convnets are quite interpretable, remember? ==> section 9.4, Chollet!
