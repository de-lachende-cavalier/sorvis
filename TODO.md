- [x] finish reviewing the material on distill
- [x] separate the useful code from the visualization et alia and put it into a separate notebook
  - [x] create a git repo to track everything (it will be the project repo)
- [x] check that training progresses as it should (something weird seems to be happening?)
  - [x] check the tensor shapes and track everything (!)
- [ ] read and understand the mnist CA distill article and rebuild the model (in simplified form, as before)
- [ ] make the main notebook more verbose
- [ ] download quick! draw data (only some classes are enough, probably)
- [ ] run some experiments (check notes!)
- [ ] play around with visualizing what the network learns => convnets are quite interpretable, remember? ==> section 9.4, Chollet!
- [Â ] write a better README!
